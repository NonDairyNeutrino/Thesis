abstract = { Abstract To help focus ideas regarding possible routes to the breakdown of Lorentz invariance, it is extremely useful to explore concrete physical models that exhibit similar phenomena. In particular, acoustics in Bose–Einstein condensates has the interesting property that at low-momentum the phonon dispersion relation can be written in a "relativistic" form exhibiting an approximate "Lorentz invariance." Indeed all of low-momentum phonon physics in this system can be reformulated in terms of relativistic curved-space quantum field theory. In contrast, high-momentum phonon physics probes regions where the dispersion relation departs from the relativistic form and thus violates Lorentz invariance. This model provides a road-map of at least one route to broken Lorentz invariance. Since the underlying theory is manifestly physical this type of breaking automatically avoids unphysical features such as causality violations. This model hints at the type of dispersion relation that might be expected at ultra-high energies, close to the Planck scale, where quantum gravity effects are suspected to possibly break ordinary Lorentz invariance. }

title = {Modelling Planck-scale Lorentz violation via analogue models},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {Astrophysical tests of Planck-suppressed Lorentz violations had been extensively studied in recent years and very stringent constraints have been obtained within the framework of effective field theory. There are however still some unresolved theoretical issues, in particular regarding the so called ‘‘naturalness problem’’ - which arises when postulating that Planck suppressed Lorentz violations arise only from operators with mass dimension greater than four in the Lagrangian. In the work presented here we shall try to address this problem by looking at a condensed-matter analogue of the Lorentz violations considered in quantum gravity phenomenology. specifically, we investigate the class of two-component BECs subject to laserinduced transitions between the two components, and we show that this model is an example for Lorentz invariance violation due to ultraviolet physics. We shall show that such a model can be considered to be an explicit example high-energy Lorentz violations where the ‘‘naturalness problem’’ does not arise.}

abstract = {We present an analogue-emergent spacetime that reproduces the salient features of the most common ansätze used for quantum gravity phenomenology. We do this by investigating a system of two-coupled Bose–Einstein condensates. This system can be tuned to have two ‘phonon’ modes (one massive, one massless) which share the same limiting speed in the hydrodynamic approximation. The system nevertheless possesses (possibly non-universal) Lorentz violating terms once ‘quantum pressure’ becomes important. We investigate the physical interpretation of the relevant fine-tuning conditions, and discuss the possible lessons and hints that this analogue spacetime could provide for the phenomenology of real physical quantum gravity. In particular we show that the effective field theory of quasi-particles in such an emergent spacetime does not exhibit the so-called ‘naturalness problem’.}

abstract = {The so-called ‘analogue models’ use condensed matter systems (typically hydrodynamic) to set up an ‘effective metric’ and to model curved-space quantum field theory in a physical system where all the microscopic degrees of freedom are well understood. Known analogue models typically lead to massless minimally coupled scalar fields. We present an extended ‘analogue spacetime’ programme by investigating a condensed-matter system—in and beyond the hydrodynamic limit—that is in principle capable of simulating the massive Klein–Gordon equation in a curved spacetime. Since many elementary particles have mass, this is an essential step in building realistic analogue models, and an essential first step towards simulating quantum gravity phenomenology. Specifically, we consider the class of two-component BECs subject to laser-induced transitions between the components, and we show that this model is an example for Lorentz invariance violation due to ultraviolet physics. Furthermore, our model suggests constraints on quantum gravity phenomenology in terms of the ‘naturalness problem’ and ‘universality issue’.}

abstract = {Phonons in expanding Bose–Einstein condensates with wavelengths much larger than the healing length behave in the same way as quantum fields within a universe undergoing an accelerated expansion. This analogy facilitates the application of many tools and concepts known from general relativity (such as horizons) and the prediction of the corresponding effects such as the freezing of modes after horizon crossing and the associated amplification of quantum fluctuations. Basically the same amplification mechanism is (according to our standard model of cosmology) supposed to be responsible for the generation of the initial inhomogeneities—and hence the seeds for the formation of structures such as our galaxy—during cosmic inflation (i.e., a very early epoch in the evolution of our universe). After a general discussion of the analogy (analogue cosmology), we calculate the frozen and amplified density–density fluctuations for quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) and three-dimensional (3D) condensates which undergo a free expansion after switching off the (longitudinal) trap.}

Our approach involves the derivation of a simplified  quantum kinetic theory, in which all processes are treated locally.   It is shown that this kinetic theory can then be transformed into a number of phase-space representations, of which the  Wigner function description, although approximate, is shown to be the most advantageous.  In this description, the quantum kinetic master  equation takes the form of a Gross-Pitaevskii equation with noise and damping added  according to a well defined prescription - an equation we call the  stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation. From this, a very  simplified description we call the phenomenological growth equation can be derived.  We use this equation to study (i) the nucleation and  growth of vortex lattices, and (ii) nonlinear losses in a hydrogen condensate, which it is shown can lead to a curious instability phenomenon.}
