During the moments just after the Big Bang, particles were produced due to the rapid expansion of the universe. Because direct observation of the universe at this time is impossible, a lab-based ultra-cold quantum gas can be used as an analog.  Previous research has been done to computationally model these gases while restricted to a quasi-two-dimensional geometry.  This restriction yields an analog universe with two only spatial dimensions and a description of a reduced momentum distribution of the created particles.  A computational model simulating an unrestricted gas and an analog universe with three spatial dimensions requires the use of high-performance computing.  I aim to use high-performance computing to simulate the full-dimensional system. This will allow me to measure the error associated with using a reduced-dimensional model, and determine the cost-benefit ratio to using a high-performance implementation.
